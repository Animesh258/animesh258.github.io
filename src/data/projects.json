    "summary": "Full Excel data pipeline project analyzing rising sales and declining profit margins to recommend a revised discount strategy, leveraging high customer loyalty.",
    "longDescription": "This project utilized Microsoft **Excel** and its advanced features (Pivot Tables, Conditional Formatting, Slicers, and formulas like VLOOKUP/SUMIFS) to execute a complete data pipeline. The analysis focused on identifying a strong link between **discounts over 20% and negative margins** (a key insight). The workflow included robust **Data Cleaning** (date standardization) and **Feature Engineering** (calculating Profit Margin %, Customer Lifetime Value, and an 'isRepeatCustomer' flag). The final outcome was an interactive dashboard and **three actionable business recommendations**, primarily urging a rework of the discount policy and a focus on upselling to the 93.99% repeat customer base.",

    "summary": "Full **Bronze–Silver–Gold** data pipeline workflow on simulated cybercrime data, culminating in an interactive Excel dashboard built on a Star Schema model.",
    "longDescription": "This project simulated a real-world data analyst workflow, implementing a structured **Bronze (Raw) → Silver (Curated) → Gold (Analytical)** data layering system. **Power Query** and **Excel** were used extensively for data cleaning and transformation in the Silver layer. The Gold layer focused on building a robust **Star Schema Data Model** (Fact and Dimension tables) in **Power Pivot** to support the final analysis. The outcome is an interactive Excel dashboard used for **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, allowing users to analyze simulated cybercrime trends across states, crime types, and time buckets.",
